# Exploring Climate Data
*Audience: The Climate Curious*

The goal of this repo is to explore different pieces of climate data in order to highlight the climate problem that earth is experiencing.  See the list of projects below, then click on the folder you are interested in learning more about.


## CO$_2$ Basics

In this notebook you can find some exploration of atmospheric CO$_2$ readings including an investigation of the seasonal component along with the underlying linear trend.  The notebook concludes with a time series analysis that forecasts atmospheric CO$_2$ levels 15 years into the future [2022 to 2037].


## Future Projects
*This repo is a work in progress.  Here are some additional projects I am considering*

- CO$_2$
  - CO$_2$ Basics Expansion:
    - Perform additional time series analysis (Prophet and other tools)
    - Add cross-validation
    - Consider running on Daily data
    - Show 2020/2021 levels
  - Paleoclimate CO$_2$ data
  - Multiple sampling stations
    - View the difference in seasonality
    - Calculate time lag
- Greenhouse Effect
  - Solar irradiance
  - Methane
  - Bands - what doubling does - may add to CO$_2$ section
- Temperature
  - Global Mean Surface Temperature
  - British sampling - oldest continuous station
  - Multiple stations:
    - Show how temperature changes vary at different sites
    - Either use GISTEMP of whole earth or pick a few stations 
      - Reno, NV
- Ocean
  - Surface temperature
  - Temp at depth
  - Acidification
